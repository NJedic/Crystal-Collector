## Getting Started

* Launch the Scooby Doo Crystal Collector Game [here!] 

* At the beginning of the game, you will be shown a random number! Your job is to match that number without going over!

* Each of the four crystals below has a specific value. Click on them to add that value to your total number but - be careful! - if you go over, you lose!

* The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it, so keep your eyes peeled!

* At the beginning of every round, all of the numbers will reset and your wins and losses will be tracked!

* Good Luck, Cool Cat, and have fun playing!

As you click on the crystals (and divine their values), "Your Number" will go up. Keep an eye on it to make sure you dont go over!

At the end of each round, "This Round's Number" will reset as will the values of the crystals allowing you to play again! And whether you win or lose, the game will track that too in the "Your Score" section!
