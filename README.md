## Overview

Scooby Doo's Crystal Collector is a super groovy game that has you matching your wits against the computer while putting your math skills to the test!

## Getting Started

* Launch the Scooby Doo Crystal Collector Game [here!] 

* At the beginning of the game, you will be shown a random number! Your job is to match that number without going over!

* Each of the four crystals below has a specific value. Click on them to add that value to your total number but - be careful! - if you go over, you lose!

* The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it, so keep your eyes peeled!

* At the beginning of every round, all of the numbers will reset and your wins and losses will be tracked!

* Good Luck, Cool Cat, and have fun playing!
